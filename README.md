# rf_triangulation

This is a project in which we will attempt to develop code that enable users of an automated radio telemetry array to localize a tag moving though space via triangulation.

Project Goals:

1) Estimate bearings from any radio reciever given recieved signal strengths on neighboring antennas attached.
2) With simultaenous detections on multiple towers, attempt to estimate one bearing from each tower detection.
3) Use each towers bearing (at least 2) to triangulation (or biangulate) a location.

End Products:

1) Stand a long methodology for application on any number of array configurations
2) Use as part of a 2 method system in which triangulation constricts parameter space for another localization method.
